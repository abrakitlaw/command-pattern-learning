# Command Pattern Learning
The Command Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern and is part of the Gang of Four's formal list of design pattern.

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests,
queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

The Command Pattern allows us to decouple the requester of an action from the object that actualy performs the action.
